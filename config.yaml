    title: "About Me"

    content: |-
     I am an electrical engineer and a devoted researcher. My main concept is to learn and grow via academic and practical experience.

      I graduated from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology with a degree in electrical and electronic engineering and made the Dean's list (CGPA:3.86).

      I work as a full-time lecturer in the Department of Electrical Electronic and Communication Engineering at the Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST), where my major responsibility is to impart theoretical and practical lessons. Here, I also offer my expertise in electronics field-based research. I also currently serve as a part-time lecturer at South East University's Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering.

      Furthermore, since my last year of university, I've been performing research under my thesis supervisor. Semiconductor materials, nanoelectronics, optical sensors, VLSI design, and biosensors are some of my research interests.

      Four of my nanoelectronics-related research articles have already been published (2 journals, and 2 conference papers). I am now exploring biosensor devices to enrich my research ideas.
